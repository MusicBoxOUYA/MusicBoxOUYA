MusicBox for OUYA
============

MusicBox for OUYA is designed to be a web-based multiuser jukebox for use in playing music at parties or robotics meetings. It is an Android application that runs on the OUYA game console, and serves a web-based interface. 

MusicBox's library is provided by a USB storage device connected to the console. It automatically discovers metadata and organizes songs into a library. 

Users are able to use the web interface to view the currently playing song, view the library, queue new songs, and vote on which songs should be played more often.
